## Vision

I believe **education should be accessible to all**. Not everyone can afford expensive bootcamps or courses but everyone deserves the chance to build, create and thrive in tech.

This project is my way of giving back to the community:

- **For learners** 🧑‍🎓: a structured, hands-on curriculum that starts simple and grows with you.
- **For collaborators** 🤝: an open playground to contribute, refine and expand.
- **For sponsors/partners** 💡: a chance to invest in **free education at scale**, empowering the next wave of developers.
